                    <p>Web Developer</p>
                    <p className='subtitle'>
                        I earned a specialized Software Developer degree from
                        Softuni, specializing in Python. The program included
                        the fundamentals of programming as well as advanced
                        abilities for full-stack web development. With a strong
                        emphasis on Python, including frameworks such as Django
                        and Flask, I learned the competence required to
                        negotiate the difficulties of software development,
                        establishing Python as the core of my skill set.

                    <p>Computer Graphics / High School Degree</p>
                    <p className='subtitle'>
                        I received a High School diploma with a specialization
                        in Computer Graphics, with a focus on the confluence of
                        technology and artistic expression. My studies in art
                        and design gave me a thorough understanding of visual
                        communication. This training experience not only boosted
                        my creativity but also provided me with practical
                        knowledge of many design tools and processes.
